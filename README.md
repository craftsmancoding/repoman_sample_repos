Repoman Sample Repos
====================

Some sample components for use with Repoman. Each folder represents a sample repository.  They demonstrate MODX components of various complexity so you can see what Repoman (https://github.com/craftsmancoding/repoman) can do.

Normally when working with Repoman, you will want to set aside a directory in your MODX webroot as a container of your local repositories, e.g. /home/public_html/repos/. Inside that directory you can clone Git repositories.  When trying out these sample packages, however, the downloaded folder will temporarily replace your "repos" folder.
